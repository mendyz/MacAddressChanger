# MacAddressChanger
Linux mac address changer using primarily ifconfig allows for manual changes to any device, or can pull all devices and loop through them creating random MAC addresses that adhere to the last 6 in ':' colon based mac address systems. Allows for default of eth0 and a random MAC, but also allows for manually changing. Allows control from command line parameters as well using optparse. Written in Python 3. Will update optparse to argparse. Will update to quite and verbose. Matches MACs to via regex to ensure changes were made.
